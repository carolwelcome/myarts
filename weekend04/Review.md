## [Distributed systems theory for the distributed systems engineer](https://www.the-paper-trail.org/post/2014-08-09-distributed-systems-theory-for-the-distributed-systems-engineer/)

In My opinion:
* Recommend papers is often precisely the wrong way to go about learning distributed systems theory (unless you are in a PhD program)
* Particularly material is shortage without condescending

### Q:What distributed systems theory should a distributed systems engineer know?
Four Reading were used to explain what about building distributed systems.
* [Distributed Systems for Fun and Profit](http://book.mixu.net/distsys/)
* [Notes on distributed systems for young bloods](http://www.somethingsimilar.com/2013/01/14/notes-on-distributed-systems-for-young-bloods/)
* [A Note on Distributed Systems](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.41.7628)
* [The fallacies of distributed computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing)

### Q: difficulties engineer faced
* processes many fail
* there is no good way to tell that they have done so

Failure and Time

The basic tension of fault tolerance

Basic primitives


Fundamental Results

Real systems:Do this over and over again.
