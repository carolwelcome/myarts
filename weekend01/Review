From Dappery, a Large Scale Distributed Systems Tracing Infrastructure

1.three  design goals of Dapper:
	a.low overhead:a sample of just one out of thousands of requests provides sufficient information for many common uses of the tracing data.
	b.Application_level transparency: Dapper is restricted to a low enough level in the software stack that even largescale distributed systems like Google web search could be traced without additional annotations.
	c.Scalability: handle the size of Googleâ€™s services and clusters for at least the next few years

2.other similiar tracing systems:
	a.Magpie
	b.X-Trace
	c.Pinpoint	
3. a tree of nested RPCs
	model traces using trees,spans annotation.
	span id 
	parent span id
